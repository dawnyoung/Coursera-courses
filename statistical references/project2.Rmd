##Load necessary package and the ToothGrowth data
```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
data("ToothGrowth")
```

##Basic explortary data analysis
```{r, cache=TRUE}
p <- ggplot(ToothGrowth, 
            aes(x = factor(supp), y = len, fill = factor(dose))) +
  geom_boxplot()
print(p)
```


##Brief summary
```{r, cache=TRUE}
summary(ToothGrowth)
```

##Hypothesis test
Null hypothesis: both the supp and dose have no effect on the growth of tooth
```{r, cache=TRUE}
fit <- aov(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$supp + ToothGrowth$dose)
anova(fit)
```
We can see that both the p-values of supp and dose are less than 0.05. 

Therefore, at 95% confidence level, the null hypothesis should be rejected, which mean both supp and dose have significant effect on tooth growth.
