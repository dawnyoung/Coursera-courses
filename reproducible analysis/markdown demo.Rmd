Markdown Demo
-------------
This is my first markdown.

Write R code:

```{r}
a <- rnorm(10,5, 1)
summary(a)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#eval = FALSE, do not show the result of the code
barplot(a)
```

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
mean(a)
```
echo=FALSE: do not show the code, only result  
plot is the name of the r chunk

hide the result
```{r, results='hide'}
median(a)
```

insert the R code into sentences  
My favorite number is `r mean(a)` .

That is how you write a R code.

write opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, results = "hide"), all the code and results would be hided by default. if you want to show the code, you need to type echo = TRUE for each chunk.

cache = TRUE, the output of the chunk woulb saved in disk. if nothing changes, the next time you run the code, the result would be loaded from the cache.

unordered list:  

*element 1  

*element 2
